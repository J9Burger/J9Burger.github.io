	<h1>Janine Burger</h1>
	<p>I am studying BSc Computer Science at University of Pretoria. I am in my third and final year.</p>
	<p>I have previously worked in a molecular laboratory and have completed a bachelor honours degree in genetics. 
	I wish to possibly integrate my knowledge of molecular biology with my new knowledge in programming.
	I am interested in AI and databasing.
	I spend my free time playing computer games, reading, watching movies and series as well as enjoying art.</p>
